Introduction
======================

This repository contains simple Python 3 demo code associated with a series of blog posts about generating PDFs from Python. The code is open source (BSD licensed) and free for you to use.

To run the demo, just type `python3 complete_example.py`

Here are the blog posts that explain how and why you would use this code:

* [PDFs from Python, Part 1](http://blog.pyspoken.com/2016/07/27/creating-pdf-documents-using-libreoffice-and-python/)
* [PDFs from Python, Part 2](http://blog.pyspoken.com/2016/08/12/creating-pdf-documents-using-libreoffice-and-python-part-2/)
* [PDFs from Python, Part 3](http://blog.pyspoken.com/2016/10/07/creating-pdf-documents-using-libreoffice-and-python-part-3/)

I also gave a [talk on this topic at PyOhio 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwWvz5QLtiI).

Included in this repository is `content.xml` which is a formatted version of the LibreOffice document's XML before this code modifies it. You can generate this file yourself (by unzipping `input.odt`), but it's nice to have a formatted copy that's easy to access.
